## 📈 **Key Steps Taken:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍  
   - Analyzed and understood the dataset to uncover valuable insights.  
   - Visualized the distribution of car prices using various plots. 📊  
   - Identified patterns in car features such as brand, model, and mileage.

2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️  
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data into useful features.  
   - Handled missing values, scaled numeric features, and encoded categorical features. 🔄  
   - Created new features like "age of the car" and "mileage to price ratio."

3. **Model Building** 🤖  
   - Split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.  
   - Built and tuned machine learning models:  
     - Linear Regression 📝  
     - Random Forest 🌲  
     - XGBoost (for boosting accuracy) 💡  
   - Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R-squared.

4. **Price Prediction** 📉  
   - Final model used to predict car prices accurately based on given features.  
   - Achieved good prediction accuracy! 🎯
